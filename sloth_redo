# R project - Sloth Species and Conservation Stauts Analysis 
# Group: Antonella Mastropierro, Allison Sermarini, Giulia Lucaccioni


# The data set we retrieved from "Kaggle" is data compiled by "Bertie"
# The data set is composed of various information regarding two sloth species: two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths
# The information included in the data set includes the following variables:
# Index: the number of observations
# Original Variable Name: Index
# Modified Variable Name: column removed
# Sloth Main Species: The main species of the sloths: two-toed or three-toed (qualitative - character)
# Original Variable Name: specie
# Modified Variable Name: main_species
# Sloth Subspecies:The subspecies of sloths within each of the main species (qualitative - character)
# Original Variable Name: sub_specie
# Modified Variable Name: sub_species
# Endangered Status: The endangered status category which each sloth observation falls into (qualitative - numeric)
# Original Variable Name: endangered
# Modified Variable Name: endangered_status
# Claw Length (cm): The claw length of each sloth observation in centimeters (quantitative - numeric)
# Original Variable Name: claw_length_cm
# Modified Variable Name: claw_length_cm 
# Size (cm):  The combined head and body size of each sloth observation in centimeters (quantitative - numeric)
# Orginial Variable Name: size_cm
# Modified Variable Name: size_cm 
# Tail Length (cm): The tail length of each sloth observation in centimeters (quantitative - numeric)
# Orginial Variable Name: tail_length_cm
# Modified Variable Name: tail_length_cm 
# Weight (kg): The weight of each sloth observation in kilograms (quantitative - numeric)
# Orginial Variable Name: weight_kg
# Modified Variable Name: weight_kg
# Total Length (cm): The total lenght of each sloth obersvation
# This variable is not in the original data set, only in the modifed data set
# The variable combines the size_cm and tail_length_cm variables
# Modified Variable Name: total_length_cm

# Based on this data set we will be completing the following objectives:
# 1. What is the absolute frequency distribution of the observations in regards to endangered status
# 2. What is the distribution of observations within each subspecies in the data set
# 3. What is the average claw size for each main species and which of the two main species have the longer claws on average
# 4. What is the relationship between the subspecies and weight/size distribution for for each of the two main species

# H0: no correlation
# H1: positive correlation -> total_length_cm ~ weight_kg

         data_2t$weight_kg)

# The test returned a correlation of 0.12 indicating that total length does not behave according to weight

# First Hypothesis Test: Three-Toed Sloth
# H0: no correlation
# H1: positive correlation -> total_length_cm ~ weight_kg
cor.test(data_3t$total_length_cm,
